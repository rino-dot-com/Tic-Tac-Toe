# Tic-Tac-Toe

Just a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe I made a few years ago. It implements the minimax algorithm to create an AI opponent. Amazing artwork done in Microsoft Paint by yours truly.

Open the HTML file in a web browser to play the game.

There are radio buttons at the top of the page to change different options:</br>
Game Mode - switch between single player to play against the AI opponent or multiplayer to play with a friend</br>
Difficulty - select the difficulty of the AI; Easy picks random squares so you can actually win; Hard uses an algorithm and is impossible to beat, but it's still fun to try</br>
Starting Player - choose whether you or the AI goes first</br>
Symbol for Player - pick which symbol you want to play as against the computer; multiplayer always does crosses first

Click the "New Game"/"Reset" button to start a new game and apply the current settings.

*I realize now that I misspelled "nought" in the files...oops...*
